## Summary

Prompt for generating a compliance audit checklist. 

## Prompt üí°

Create a super realistic 9:16 vertical (portrait) selfie featuring me (match the attached photo reference) with Michael Jackson, Prince, Whitney Houston, and Tina Turner. Style all four exactly as in the 1980s (hair, wardrobe, makeup, era-correct textures). Scene: cramped, grimy backstage room after a concert‚Äîscuffed floors, road cases, soft practicals, ambient haze. Camera: high-angle selfie, arm‚Äôs-length, slight lens distortion. Lighting: realistic cinematic; motivated by a single warm bulb and spill from a hallway, rich contrast without crushed blacks, clean skin texture (no plastic look). Mood: laid-back, we look effortlessly cool. Composition: subjects naturally clustered, shoulders overlapping, believable depth and occlusion. Finish: photo-realistic 3D aesthetic, grain matched to ISO 1600 film, subtle chromatic aberration, era-accurate color palette.
