# Fixing your code using GitHub copilot

![Screenshot of the prompt in use](./assets/prompt.png)

## Summary

## Prompt üí°
Can you please help me fix my code? I'm trying to accomplish 'blank' using 'blank' (insert your technology here).
The code I'm using is crea8_attachment is not equal to null.
Please highlight what I'm not doing correctly, and provide tips how I can improve in the future. 

### Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

It might sound straight forward, but this is such a helpful prompt. 

For example, I wanted to set up a trigger condition, but couldn't remember the exact syntax.
I asked it to check my code; 
```powerfx
triggerOutputs()?['body/crea8_attachment'] is not equal to null
```
 and it helped me with: 

```powerfx
@equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/HasAttachments'], true)
```
It guided me through the syntax, gave me multiple scenarios and gave tips how I could approach this next time.
