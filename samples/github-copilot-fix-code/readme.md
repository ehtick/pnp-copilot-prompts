# Fixing your code using GitHub Copilot

![Screenshot of the prompt in use](./assets/prompt.png)

## Summary

This guide explains how to use GitHub Copilot to fix your code by providing effective prompts, troubleshooting tips, and practical examples for improving your workflow.

## Prompt üí°
Can you please help me fix my code? I'm trying to accomplish 'blank' using 'blank' (insert your technology here).
The code I'm using is:
```powerfx
triggerOutputs()?['body/crea8_attachment'] is not equal to null
```
Please highlight what I'm not doing correctly, and provide tips how I can improve in the future. 

### Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è

It might sound straight forward, but this is such a helpful prompt. 

For example, I wanted to set up a trigger condition, but couldn't remember the exact syntax.
I asked it to check my code: 
```powerfx
triggerOutputs()?['body/crea8_attachment'] is not equal to null
```
 and it helped me with: 

```powerfx
@equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/HasAttachments'], true)
```
It guided me through the syntax, gave me multiple scenarios and gave tips how I could approach this next time.

## Instructions üìù

1. Make sure you have GitHub Copilot extension installed in VSCode and enable it
2. Launch GitHub Copilot Chat using `Cmd+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows)
3. Copy the above prompt, paste, and press `Enter`
4. Check your output and select the suggestion you need, copy into your designated area.

### Improvise Usage üöÄ
You can change the prompt to fit your business purpose. You can also explain other things alongside 'fixing' your code. Sometimes Copilot will grab info from an .md file you have open, or from an older chat. Try using /clear if that happens.
