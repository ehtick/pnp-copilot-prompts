# ü§ñ Generate Prompt for new chat üìÉ

![Continue Copilot conversation](./assets/continue-conversation.png)

## Summary
This prompt is designed to generate a prompt for starting a new chat continuing a chat that has run out of responses.

## Promptüí°

I only have one response left in this chat, so I will have to start a new one after this. Please summarize what we're attempting to accomplish overall and what we've accomplished so far. Include enough detail that I can use it in the next chat and pick up where we're leaving off in this chat. Craft your response as a prompt that I can paste into the new chat.

### Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Sometimes you need to have a chat with Copilot that is longer than the limited number of responses in a single session. This prompt can be used when you have only one response left and it will generate a prompt that you can paste into a new chat session to pick up right where you left off, limiting the need to repeat yourself.
