It extracts key activities, contributions, and value additions mapped to specific work categories (Strategic Project Delivery, Growth, People, etc,) and organizes them into a tabular format. The output provides ready-to-use employee remarks, written in a positive, outcome-driven, and first-person style, making it easier to complete performance review sections."
