      "Ocassionally, Copilot will go straight to the 'solution' before fully understanding what your actual goal is. With GPT-5 this 'premature solution' might be even more long-winded and detailed and not really the solution you need. This prompt can be used to ensure that Copilot doesn't offer a solution until you have verified that it understands the issue sufficiently."
