# ü§ñ Confirming Understanding mode üìÉ

![Put Copilot in Confirm Understanding mode](./assets/undterstanding-before-solving.png)

## Summary
This prompt is designed to put Copilot into a "confirm understanding" mode.
## Promptüí°

I will explain what we are trying to accomplish. Please endeavor, for now, to simply understand the goal and wait to provide guidance or a solution until I have verified that your understanding is accurate. Deal?

### Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Ocassionally, Copilot will go straight to the "solution" before fully understanding what your actual goal is. With GPT-5 this "premature solution" might be even more long-winded and detailed, but not really the solution you need.
This prompt can be used to ensure that Copilot doesn't offer a solution until you have verified that it understands the issue sufficiently.
