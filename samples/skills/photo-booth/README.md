## Summary

Create a photorealistic 3x3 photo-booth grid from reference images while keeping the people, wardrobe, setting, lighting, and framing visually consistent across all nine panels.

## Skill

The full skill definition is in [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md). Package it as a ZIP file with `SKILL.md` at the archive root, then upload the package to a Declarative Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Builder.

### Trigger Phrases

Say any of these to Microsoft 365 Copilot to activate the skill:

- "Create a photo-booth grid from these images"
- "Make a 3x3 couple selfie grid"
- "Generate an emotion grid with the same people"
- "Create synchronized portrait variations from these references"

## Description

This skill analyzes supplied reference images, defines a continuity lock for the people and photographic treatment, plans nine synchronized expressions or micro-poses, and generates a single square 3x3 master image. It then reviews the result for consistent identities, wardrobe, backdrop, lighting, framing, and face visibility.

The skill requires a primary reference image. A partner reference is optional; when one is not supplied, the user can describe a fictional or generic partner concept instead.
